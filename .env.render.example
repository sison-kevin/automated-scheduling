# Example Render environment variables
# These are examples only — do NOT commit real credentials.

APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false

# Database settings (only set these if your app reads env vars)
DB_HOST=your_db_host_here
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_db_name_here
DB_USERNAME=your_db_user_here
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password_here

# Other common variables
APP_URL=https://your-app-url.onrender.com

# Note: Your project currently includes a direct DB config in
# `userpanel-backend/app/config/database.php`. If that file contains
# hard-coded FreeSQLDatabase credentials, you do NOT need to set DB_* here.
# Only add these to Render's environment variables if you want to override
# the values in your code.
